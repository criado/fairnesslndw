			"conclusion1": "When connections can't take any more, they turn red.",
            "during2": "But what if common links can't take everyone's needs? Then we have to share! Make them happy by sharing fairly.",
            "conclusion2": "Nice! But... what does it mean to be fair? The assignment should satisfy 4 simple properties (check the poster). There is only one way to satisfy them!!",
			"during3": "Now make everyone happy by giving them what is fair. :D\n\nRemember there is only one way to satisfy the 4 fairness properties.\nThey imply that whoever uses more resources should receive less, since they slow everyone too much.",

            "conclusion3": "You guessed it, the bar is the total info delivered. And look! Things are now fair but the bar has decreased.  The gap is called the price of fairness",
            "conclusion3b": "Have you noticed that here the fair thing to do was to give red half of what others receive because red uses twice as many critical connections?",
            "during4": "Oh my, now the connections are not equally thick. Giving red 1/3 of what the others get won't help now.",
            "conclusion4": "Computing these solutions gets harder and harder the more complex the network is. We studied this and more general problems in our research",
			"during5": "Wow! Such a high left bar. But sooo unfair ðŸ˜©\nThis is our last challenge.",
            "conclusion5": "Fair enough! You solved the hardest level!\nTell your friends to play the game as well! Click to reset.",
